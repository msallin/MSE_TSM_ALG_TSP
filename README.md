# TSP Problem Playground

## Introduction

This code provides a framework for implementing algorithms, which aim solve the travelling sales man problem.
The Java version of this code is provided in the module TSM_Alg (MSc in Engineering degree course) from Mark Cieliebak.

## Contributors

Mark Cieliebak wrote the Java version.
The inital port was created from Riedi Linus (linriedi@hotmail.com).
My contribution was to migrate it from .NET Core 1.0 Preview, to .NET Core 3.0 and apply some minor code cleanups and making it self contained.
